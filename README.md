# public-api-requests

This project is the fifth task for Teamtreehouse's "Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree".

For this project, I had to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world.
I had to use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,”.
And then to use that data to build an employee directory listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location.
Clicking the employee’s image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

I wrote all of the JavaScript code in the js files.

The html and css files were provided by Teamtreehouse.
